Thank you for using CryptMessage!


Installation:

You need to have Java 1.8.0 installed:
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

Extract the CryptMessage folder and run the executable.



The purpose of this program is to allow the creation of cryptic messages through a customized language. Users can create their own cryptographic language, save 
it, and send it to others via internet. This allows for safe sending of sensitive information such as phone numbers, credit cards numbers, addresses, meet up 
times, and for anything else you would like to be confidential as text. 



1. Using the program

The CryptMessage panel must have a language set before proper usage. If you do not have a language, feel free to use the included "SampleLanguage" or 
create your own using the editor (available under options). Otherwise, use the change option to open a Cryptic Message File (.cmf). The name of the language should 
be shown in the box under the input box. This will be the language that will translate the string inside the input box and display the result in the output box.
If you are trying to translate a message in cryptic form using the same language, select the checkbox located to the left of the translate button.



2. The editor

Using the built-in editor, you can create your own cryptic language. There are many uses for your language, such as having a personal one for a friend, using one 
for a group chat, or even using a personal one for notes. Each character has their own designated string that will replace that character. For example, if "S" is
set to "2717" then whenever there is a capital S in a message, it will display 2717 instead, so that means 27172717 translates to SS. Please note that every text
box must contain exactly the amount of characters the "Text Size" specifies. It is by default 1, but you can change it up to 10. Anything bigger than 10 can create
really lengthy output that are incapable of sending anything as a message.
